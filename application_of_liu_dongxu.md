# Abstract of my thesis

## Intelligent social network research based on augmented reality

The social networking platform on the market today is dominated by instant messaging,
pan-media and short video which feature large volume of information, inclination to
entertainment content and well-designed addiction mechanism to attract users, causing more and more negative effects on university students.
This paper proposes a intelligent social system based on augmented reality and makes
content on social media to be the interaction center. With the help of augmented reality technology, it combines simulated social information with real-life social scenes, screening and categorizing social information by the specialty of different social scenes, and guiding users to focus on learning plans (or other life goals) published in AR scenarios, which, as a result, effectively avoids information overload and reduces invalid and inefficient social interaction. The system adopts a client-server architecture, and the client is based on the Swift programming language and the Cocoa Touch framework. ARKit 2.0 is used to develop an augmented reality interface, and Core Data framework for local data persistence. The development of the system server interface uses the go-gin micro framework, as well as the gorm framework to drive the Mysql database, and therefore realizes server-side data access.
